      "summary": "This recipe appears in: Sweet Cultured Butter and True Buttermilk From 'The Nourished Kitchen' [Photograph: Jennifer McGruther] The thought of homemade butter conjures images of large wooden butter churns and hours of arm-busting labor. But these days, butter is actually quite easy to make. If you have a stand mixer, you have have it ready to eat in only a few short minutes. Jennifer McGruther takes one extra step in her butter recipe in The Nourished Kitchen. Before churning, she cultures cream for 24 hours to add distinctive tang and a little more nutrition to the butter itself. Culturing the cream requires little more than a splash of cultured buttermilk and a bit of patience. The next day, the now tangy cream takes a spin in a stand mixer until it separates. The resulting butter then just needs a bit of draining and it's ready for toast, vegetables, and plenty of baking. Why I picked this recipe: Why wouldn't I want to have a stash of homemade butter in the fridge? What worked: Really, homemade butter couldn't be easier. Plus, it tastes worlds better than the ordinary grocery store variety. What didn't: You'll want to drape a towel over the stand mixer while churning the butter. It will splatter. A lot. Suggested tweaks: A few sprinkles of flaky sea salt is a fine addition.

But if you're like me and figure you'll mess up cooking anything without a recipe, this is for you. Feel free to tweak the amount of lemon and ginger or to cook for a shorter amount of time depending on your flavor preferences—this is not a hard-and-fast recipe. (Just don't boil it for too long; you're not making a syrup.) Some recipes suggest leaving the lemon out of the boiling stage and adding it at the end.

    "summary": "This recipe appears in: From The Pastry Dungeon: Wild Mulberry Buttermilk Ice Cream [Photograph: Anna Markow] Wild mulberries are currently at their peak in Brooklyn, and I have a gold mine of them in my new back yard. Sweet and inky, they're perfect to eat out of hand, but are also wonderful in ice cream. Buttermilk balances their pure sweetness, making a not-too-sweet frozen treat. Notes: You can substitute any berry you like for the mulberries, but you may need to increase the amount of sugar if the berries are particularly tart. Any stone fruit or even stewed rhubarb would also be excellent. The recipe is versatile and sugar can be adjusted to taste. If you prefer a completely smooth ice cream, you can fully puree the berries and strain the seeds out. Every recipe we publish is tested, tasted, and Serious Eats-approved by our staff. Never miss a recipe again by following @SeriousRecipes on Twitter! About the Author: Anna Markow is a pastry chef obsessed with doing things that no one else does and giving unusual ingredients their time to shine. You can follow her sometimes-pastry-related thoughts on Twitter @VerySmallAnna.",

          "summary": "This recipe appears in: The Homemade Pantry's Butter [Photograph: Jennifer May] Butter is one of those staple ingredients that we don't really stop and think too much about. Where does the stuff come from? The market, obviously, but before that, a butter factory? A churn? These vague ideas about butter making lead us to Alana Chernila's Homemade Butter recipe from The Homemade Pantry, a very rewarding kitchen experiment that cleared up all of our butter related queries. Well, not all of them, we'd still like to visit the butter factory. To make butter from the comfort of your home kitchen, all you need is a stand mixer, a pint of cream, and a pinch of salt. Over the course of just about 15 minutes, the cream whips, stiffens, then separates into butter and buttermilk. A little kneading later and your left with fresh butter: spreadable, just salty enough and packed with everything that's so great about butter to begin with. What Worked: Even if you're not going to make butter from scratch all the time, this is one DIY that you should try at least once. What Didn't: Heed Chernila when she warns about the spatter factor; before the cream transforms into butter you could very easily end up with a big cleanup. Suggested Tweaks: Herbs, spices, chiles—throw them in. The sky's the limit when you're churning your own. Reprinted with permission from The Homemade Pantry by Alana Chernila. Copyright © 2012.

"Bring your well-salted pasta water to a boil.",
"While the water is heating, slice the guanciale thinly into narrow strips, wide ribbons, or even a fine dice, the cut can depend on how you want the guanciale to mingle with the pasta you've chosen. (I like to bite into my guanciale, so I chose the ribbons.)",
"Sizzle, sizzle.",
"Place the guanciale in a cold sauté pan with a tablespoon or two of olive oil and place over medium heat; the olive oil helps to render the fat evenly and acts as a conduit, transferring the flavor from the pan to the pasta.",
"Drop the pasta into the water as you slowly sauté the guanciale.",
"The goal here is to slowly soften the fat, keeping it translucent; avoid letting it turn brown and crisp, or the pleasure of biting into those soft, juicy, fatty parts will be lost.",
"When the guanciale has softened, add a small splash of water from the pasta pot.",
"Lower the heat, and keep dribbling in spoonfuls of pasta cooking water as it evaporates, just enough to keep the guanciale moist.",
"The starchy water is a key element to the finished dish; it combines with the fat to form the \"sauce\" for the pasta.",
"When the pasta reaches that perfectly al dente texture, scoop out about a cup of the cooking water and set it aside.",
"Quickly drain your pasta and add it to the pan, then turn up the heat and listen for some sizzle.",
"Toss the pasta vigorously, coating it with the guanciale and rendered fat, and add a small splash of the reserved pasta cooking water if necessary to bring it all together.",
"Remove the pan from the heat and add the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, but avoid the temptation to add too much.",
"The cheese is there to help bind the guanciale to pasta and add that perfect, sheep-y backnote.",
"Grind some black pepper into the pan, toss well and serve immediately on a heated plate.",
"Ecco!",
"There you have it: simplicity, balance and harmony on a plate.",
"Enjoy it with a glass of wine from the Castelli Romani, if you can.",
"Once you've mastered Pasta alla Gricia, you're on the right path.",

"summary": "This recipe appears in: This Week in Recipes [Photo: Vicky Wasik] Carbonara, Cacio e Pepe, Amatriciana and Gricia: If you spend any extended time in Rome, these four pasta dishes are sure to become familiar and beloved friends. Together they form the backbone of primi choices at every trattoria in the Eternal City, where the locals have strong, vocal opinions on where to find the best execution of each, never all at one place. Each recipe bows to the Roman palate, where Pecorino Romano is favored over Parmigiano-Reggiano and guanciale is preferred to pancetta. There are only five or six additional ingredients needed to make all four dishes, and I learned that my Roman friends keep these components on hand at all times, ready to turn a chance encounter on the street into an impromptu meal at home, \"Come upstairs for dinner, cara. I'll make us some Amatriciana.\" Really? You don't have to run to the store first? Pasta alla Gricia is the least-known member of the group, but hands down my favorite. I can't think of a better delivery vehicle for pasta than a perfect balance of cured pork and cheese, so here's a primer on how to make this Roman classic. The first and most important step to making authentic pasta alla gricia is starting with the right ingredients. I'm sorry, but I have to be a purist here and insist on guanciale, or cured pork jowl, which has a unique, intensely piggy flavor, and Pecorino Romano, the hard, tangy grating cheese made from sheep's milk. With so few components at play, substitutions are not minor. Pancetta and Parmigiano will make a tasty dish, but you cannot call it alla gricia, for the simple reason that their flavors are quite different. The same goes for add-ins, so there should be no garlic used here, nor any onion, herbs, or wine. No. None. Nooooooo. I've seen these ingredients included in some recipes, but in Rome this is a deal breaker--as much of an affront as tossing frozen peas or heavy cream into Carbonara. Creative license is allowed, however, when it comes to the pasta. I've enjoyed bucatini, spaghetti, ditalini, mezze rigatoni, penne, and even gnocchi served alla Gricia, and they all work just fine. Guanciale You can order fantastic, authentic guanciale from Salumi Artisan Cured Meats in Seattle, or Murray's Real Salami in New York.",

"summary": "Like bacon, sliced Canadian bacon (a.k.a. breakfast ham) is not one of the meats you'd think would benefit from being cooked sous vide. It's such an easy meat to cook, not to mention that it's already par-cooked when you buy it. What benefit could there be? But as it turns out, sous-vide ham is every bit as revelatory as sous vide bacon. Cooked low and slow overnight, it retains all of its juiciness, but gains an incredibly luxurious, buttery-soft tenderness as its connective tissue and muscles break down. It's also convenient: once cooked, all you have to do is sear it on a hot skillet or griddle to crisp up the outside and give it browned flavor, and it's ready to serve.",

"Heat your sous vide supreme or immersion circulator to 156°F.",
"Establish the mise en plus for the eggs, as you want to work quickly.",
"You will need four double-layered sheets of clingfilm slightly larger than a standard piece of paper, a 3” round cutter (approx), a stand mixer or hand beaters, kitchen twine, and either a half pan (if you have a sous vide supreme) or something small and heavily weighted that you can tie your souffles to (if you are using an immersion circulator).",
"For the sous vide supreme method, be sure your water level is high enough that when you place a half pan inside the supreme (should fit perfectly), it just touches the water.",
"Beat egg whites and salt to stiff peaks.",
"Place the cutter on a flat surface and lay one sheet of clingfilm over it, making a depression in the film where the cutter is.",
"Spoon beaten egg white into the depression until the cutter is nearly full.",
"Gently place the egg yolk on top of the white.",
"Spoon just enough white over the yolk to cover it.",
"Gather the clingfilm as though it is a satchel, and tie it tightly just at the top of the egg white so you have a little beggar’s purse.",
"Quickly repeat for remaining eggs. (For immersion circulator method, tie your beggar’s purses around the heavy objects so they will remain immersed in the water bath.)",
"Drop the soufflés in the water bath (for sous vide supreme, cover with half pan so that pan keeps soufflés immersed, then fill half pan with water for stability).",
"SET A TIMER for 24 minutes.",
"Turn the oven on broil.",
"Once 24 minutes has elapsed, remove the purses from the water bath, quickly and carefully untie them, and place them tie side up on a parchment-lined baking sheet, taking care not to rip the soufflé (a small rubber spatula works well here).",
"Place them on medium rack in oven under broiler and WATCH CAREFULLY.",
"When the soufflé just begins to brown at the top, remove from oven.",
"This could be anywhere from 2-4 minutes.",
"You do not want to overcook or your yolk will lose its runny-ness.",
"Serve immediately over vegetables, with truffles, solo, or any other way you see fit."

"Cut each lemon rind into a few chunks and toss with salt in a large glass, ceramic, or stainless steel mixing bowl.",

(You can also twist the rinds in a doubled-over sheet of cheesecloth, wrapping the ends of the cheesecloth around a spoon for torque to help express the liquid; see our article on making latkes for photos and a fuller description of the technique.)",

"summary": "The soup in most bowls of ramen consists of three components: broth, an aromatic oil, and the tare, or seasoning. The tare is what gives the soup its character, and it's mostly used as a way to introduce both salinity and a punch of flavor, usually from ingredients that are extremely rich in glutamates. That includes kombu (dried kelp) and other flavorful compounds, like dried-fish products and mushrooms. This tare, made from just leftover lemon rinds, salt, and kombu, keeps it pretty simple. While it does take a couple of days to make, the vast majority of that time is spent passively (and patiently!) waiting. The tare can, of course, be used to season ramen, but it's incredibly versatile: Use it to season other soups, stews, stir-fries, and even salad dressings. It works particularly well in dishes that have a meaty or fishy component, such as a chicken stock–based pan sauce or an anchovy-heavy salad dressing.",

"summary": "This recipe appears in: In Season: Potatoes This Week in Recipes Ed Levine's Serious Diet, Week 35: Eating Meat Sparingly Is Alright Editor's Note: This is the first installment of Meat Lite, a weekly column that will celebrate meat in moderation by Philadelphia food writers Joy Manning and Tara Mataraza Desmond. Meat Lite was inspired by the book the two coauthored, Almost Meatless, coming out in Spring 2009. A jar of bacon grease. Photograph by unclerib on Flickr. Even among fats, bacon grease is considered a special kind of villain. It represents all the evils of saturated fat, calories, and cholesterol. But the fact is: bacon fat has the same amount of calories as olive oil. It's true that it has more saturated fat than some oils do, but it's no worse on that score than butter. And, if you start with high-quality bacon from Heritage pigs, it would be unforgivable to allow that flavorful fat to go to waste. I have a jar of congealed bacon fat in my fridge at all times. In my experiences, a tablespoon of bacon fat makes a tray of ultra-healthy Brussels sprouts palatable to people who claim to hate this cruciferous veggie (the cruciferous family also includes kale, cabbage, and collards). Just melt the fat down in a skillet, toss with a mess of halved Brussels sprouts, sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper, and roast those cancer-fighters at 400 degrees until they are just brown and tender. Bacon fat also makes an excellent base for sauteing aromatics in otherwise vegetarian soups. It adds tremendous depth of flavor and meatiness with a tiny amount of extra fat. But my favorite use for this wrongly vilified foodstuff is in my roasted potatoes. I eat them like French fries, as a side for mussels, burgers and salad. And yes, I serve them with an even eviler ingredient: homemade mayonnaise. But that's another post. About the author: Joy Manning is the restaurant critic for Philadelphia magazine.",

Aim for around 1 1/2 chops per person, or 2 chops per person if you want leftovers. Other aromatics like minced garlic or chopped herbs can be added along with the salt and pepper if desired. To prevent ends of ribs from burning, cap each with a piece of aluminum foil if desired. Every recipe we publish is tested, tasted, and Serious Eats-approved by our staff.

"summary": "This recipe appears in: From the Archives: The Best Beef for Grilling The Best Inexpensive Steak for the Grill, Part 3: Short Ribs [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt] The Koreans and the Argentineans know something that we don't: Short rib is the best cut of meat for grilling. I very strongly suggest cooking your short ribs to medium-rare—about 130°F. Any cooler than that and the intramuscular fat will remain solid and waxy, rather than unctuous and juicy. Much hotter and the fat will start leaking out copiously, making your ribs tough and dry. Note: English cut short ribs are short ribs that are cut with one long piece of bone in each one, about 2 1/2-inches wide and 6 inches long. Look for ribs with plenty of meat and a good amount of marbling.",

"summary": "This recipe appears in: Mark Bittman's Grilled or Broiled Steak [Photograph: Romulo Yanes] Here's a scenario that we're sure at least a few of you are familiar with. A big, beautiful steak catches your eye at the market, perhaps a dry aged ribeye or a well marbled locally raised T-bone. After a bit of inner dialogue (those things aren't cheap), you take the plug and take the steak home. Then a moment of panic hits. How am I going to cook this thing? What if I overcook it and all of its beefy deliciousness is ruined? To resolve this beef related quandary, we present Mark Bittman's Grilled or Broiled Steak from How to Cook Everything The Basics. Meat plus salt and pepper plus heat equals a great steak, no fancy stuff, no elaborate technique, just a broiler or a grill, and a knife to test the steak's doneness, and done. What Worked: This is what Mark Bittman has to say about steak: \"In a nutshell: salt, pepper, meat, heat, eat.\" It's a simple formula for a super successful steak experience. What Didn't: Not a thing, we couldn't agree more with Bittman's steak methodology. Suggested Tweaks: Here are Bittman's suggestions: Pan-Cooked Steak: A little more forgiving than using the higher-heat method: Put 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Prepare the steaks through Step 2. When the oil is warm, put the steaks in the pan (they won't sizzle), seasoned side down, and sprinkle the tops with salt and pepper. Cook until the edges begin to turn brown, 5 to 10 minutes, then turn and cook until the steak is at least 1 shade redder (or pinker) than you like, another 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, turning once, until each side is seared a little, less than a minute total. Remove from the pan, let rest, and serve with the pan drippings poured over all. Pepper Steak (Steak au Poivre): Before Step 1, coarsely grind 1 tablespoon black pepper and melt 1 tablespoon butter. Salt and pepper the steaks as described in Step 2, pressing the extra pepper into the raw steaks, then brush both sides with the butter.
