Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

      "description": "2013 was another stellar growing season in the Russian River Valley; warm spring, great flowering weather, and a long moderate ripening season. Our blocks for the Dutton Ranch blend were harvested between September 9 and October 11; the fruit was beautifully clean and ripe, and gave us wines with the acid backbone and luscious citrus and stone fruit flavors we so love from our neighborhood. This wine is about freshness and balance: in the nose it leads with Meyer lemon, pear and mineral notes, with tropical and ginger overtones. In the mouth, the lusciousness of this season is balanced by solid acidity and an evolving fruit core that keeps you coming back. Lemon sourball, ripe pear and a touch of green apple fill out the fruit profile, while the steely minerality and sweet cream add a complexity that we love in this wine. Moderate alcohol and the signature juicy acidity of Green Valley facilitate the fresh, lingering citrus/ginger finish. This is a wine that evolves in the glass and will easily reward 5 years of cellar aging, but both will be a challenge with its immediate allure.",

      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",

In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option.",

      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

      "The average fresh lime contains 2 tablespoons of lime juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lime juice).",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",

They lose much of their nutrition during transport, and the long distances are not doing the planet any good either. If you want strawberries in winter, buy them frozen! Also, strawberries are one of the worst offenders when it comes to pesticide residues found on produce, so buy organic when you can."

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
      "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

      "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

The appellation is 100% Carneros. The Brut was aged in the bottle for three years before release. It will continue to develop further depth and complexity as it ages.\n\nThis cuvée has aromas of meadow flowers, pears and citrus peel enhanced with notes of toast, vanilla and spice. The wine is elegantly structured, rich, round and flavorful with the long creamy finish that is the hallmark of Domaine Carneros wines.\n\nLovely served with double or triple cream cheeses, it also matches especially well with oysters, shellfish, fish, poultry, Asian and California cuisine.",

      "description": "2013 was another stellar growing season in the Russian River Valley; warm spring, great flowering weather, and a long moderate ripening season. Our blocks for the Dutton Ranch blend were harvested between September 9 and October 11; the fruit was beautifully clean and ripe, and gave us wines with the acid backbone and luscious citrus and stone fruit flavors we so love from our neighborhood. This wine is about freshness and balance: in the nose it leads with Meyer lemon, pear and mineral notes, with tropical and ginger overtones. In the mouth, the lusciousness of this season is balanced by solid acidity and an evolving fruit core that keeps you coming back. Lemon sourball, ripe pear and a touch of green apple fill out the fruit profile, while the steely minerality and sweet cream add a complexity that we love in this wine. Moderate alcohol and the signature juicy acidity of Green Valley facilitate the fresh, lingering citrus/ginger finish. This is a wine that evolves in the glass and will easily reward 5 years of cellar aging, but both will be a challenge with its immediate allure.",

      "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."
      ],
      "price": [
      "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). ",
      "Fresh herbs can be expensive, so don't let them go to waste. If you have any leftovers, you might be able to freeze them. The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil, while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil, chives, mint, and more."
      ],
      "cooking": [
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
      "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

      "description": "2013 was another stellar growing season in the Russian River Valley; warm spring, great flowering weather, and a long moderate ripening season. Our blocks for the Dutton Ranch blend were harvested between September 9 and October 11; the fruit was beautifully clean and ripe, and gave us wines with the acid backbone and luscious citrus and stone fruit flavors we so love from our neighborhood. This wine is about freshness and balance: in the nose it leads with Meyer lemon, pear and mineral notes, with tropical and ginger overtones. In the mouth, the lusciousness of this season is balanced by solid acidity and an evolving fruit core that keeps you coming back. Lemon sourball, ripe pear and a touch of green apple fill out the fruit profile, while the steely minerality and sweet cream add a complexity that we love in this wine. Moderate alcohol and the signature juicy acidity of Green Valley facilitate the fresh, lingering citrus/ginger finish. This is a wine that evolves in the glass and will easily reward 5 years of cellar aging, but both will be a challenge with its immediate allure.",

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off."

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds)."

For more information about selecting and storing potatoes, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/potatoes\">this lesson about potatoes</a> in the academy.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
      "Kosher salt is a type of coarse-grained salt popular among chefs because it is easy to pick up with the fingertips and sticks well when coating meat. The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you're using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.",
      "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.",

      "description": "SILVER MEDAL - 2009 San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition. In 2005, we enjoyed an ideal growing and harvest season. The combination produced a beautiful yield of chocolate and strawberry flavors, so we decided to make our first Reserve wine. This unfiltered cab aged for 21 months in 100% new French Allier, Troncais, and Centre oak barrels. Our small production, handcrafted wines are produced with minimal intervention, reflecting our vineyard's full influence in the winemaking process. Our estate vineyard produces low yield and high-quality grapes that are crushed and de-stemmed within minutes of handpicking. We produce about 2,000 cases a year of consistent, balanced, low sulfites, vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO, and nature friendly wines.",

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "You might have heard that you should never wash mushrooms. Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
      "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
      "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "There are two types of cinnamon. The more expensive and rarer type is Ceylon cinnamon (considered to be \"true cinnamon\"). The cinnamon most common in North America is cassia cinnamon. Though the flavor is certainly similar, Ceylon cinnamon is said to be more subtle yet also more complex."

The appellation is 100% Carneros. The Brut was aged in the bottle for three years before release. It will continue to develop further depth and complexity as it ages.\n\nThis cuvée has aromas of meadow flowers, pears and citrus peel enhanced with notes of toast, vanilla and spice. The wine is elegantly structured, rich, round and flavorful with the long creamy finish that is the hallmark of Domaine Carneros wines.\n\nLovely served with double or triple cream cheeses, it also matches especially well with oysters, shellfish, fish, poultry, Asian and California cuisine.",

To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

      "Before you pass up garlic because you don't want the bad breath that comes with it, keep in mind that the compounds that cause garlic breath also offer a lot of health benefits. Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
      "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
      "Lycopene, the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy), is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

      "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). ",
      "Fresh herbs can be expensive, so don't let them go to waste. If you have any leftovers, you might be able to freeze them. The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil, while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil, chives, mint, and more."

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
      "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier."

Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

      "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
      "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
      "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",
      "Kosher salt is a type of coarse-grained salt popular among chefs because it is easy to pick up with the fingertips and sticks well when coating meat. The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you're using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt."

      "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home.

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish.

If you want to create a squash bowl like I did in the photo, save one globe squash for the bowl. Just chop off the top and, using a spoon, dig out all the flesh. Toss the squash with a tablespoon of oil and a small pinch of salt, and bake on the baking sheet for about 20 minutes.\nWhen the garlic is done, open up the foil wrap and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.

      "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

      "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "When buying wine for cooking, it is certainly not a bad idea to buy a wine you would enjoy drinking (some wine for the dish, some wine for the chef?) But if your favorite wines cost a small fortune, save them for drinking and purchase a cheaper?though still good quality!?wine for cooking. Just don't buy \"cooking wine\" with added salt, food coloring, etc. ",
      "Don't have any wine in the house? Red wine vinegar and white wine vinegar can be used to deglaze pans. Chicken/beef broth or grape juice can also be used in place of wine in a pinch, especially if a recipe only calls for a small amount.",
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier."

Taste the soup, adding red pepper and turn off flame when ready. Place spinach on the bottom of your soup bowl.

In a large, shallow dish combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Toss well with a fork until the oil is completely dispersed into the bread crumbs. Combine the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water in a medium bowl. Place the flour in a large resealable bag.</li><li>Add half of the cauliflower florets to the bag with the flour, seal and shake to coat well. Remove the cauliflower to a fine mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Place the floured cauliflower on a plate. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower.</li><li>Working with a few pieces at a time. Add to the beaten egg. Using a fork, turn and toss the florets in the egg to completely coat. Transfer to the breadcrumb mixture and coat, pressing the crumbs into the florets, the help them adhere. Place on the oiled baking sheet, making sure you leave a little space between each florets so they crisp up really well. Repeat this step with the rest of the cauliflower. Spray the tops of the breaded florets lightly with cooking spray. Bake the cauliflower for 20 minutes, Flip the pieces over and continue baking for about 15 more minutes, until the cauliflower is crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.</li><li>While the cauliflower is baking, prepare the marinara. Pulse the undrained tomatoes in a food processor a few times until mostly broken down. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil with the garlic and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat until just sizzling.

      "Before you pass up garlic because you don't want the bad breath that comes with it, keep in mind that the compounds that cause garlic breath also offer a lot of health benefits. Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
      "If you're worried about cholesterol and heart disease, you may have heard you should limit your egg consumption to one egg per day or eat only egg whites. However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",
      "You can easily swap half of the white flour in most recipes for whole wheat flour to add some fiber and protein. It does result in a heavier dough, so for cookies, cakes, etc., you might try swapping in whole wheat pastry flour.",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Tangy, suave, light and clean citrus and stone fruit flavors on the palate have a fresh and crisp character. Tasted blind, it's easy to mistake this for great Champagne.\n\nCavas are very versatile as an apéritif before the meal, to accompany dessert afterwards and (surprise!) to enjoy during the meal. This Naveran Brut Vintage will pair with soft cheeses, fresh fruit, white meats (pork and chicken) and even richly flavored red meats. This Cava is great for sipping on its own, especially for receptions and other \"standing up\" events.",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

      "Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",
      "You might have heard that you should never wash mushrooms. Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
      "Traditionally, feta cheese is made from sheep's or goat's milk (or a combination of the two). Now some supermarkets sell \"feta-style\" cheeses made from cow's milk. If you want the authentic feta experience, be sure to read the label carefully."

      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "You might have heard that you should never wash mushrooms. Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

      "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

      "When buying wine for cooking, it is certainly not a bad idea to buy a wine you would enjoy drinking (some wine for the dish, some wine for the chef?) But if your favorite wines cost a small fortune, save them for drinking and purchase a cheaper?though still good quality!?wine for cooking. Just don't buy \"cooking wine\" with added salt, food coloring, etc. ",
      "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
      "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
      "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
      "Don't have any wine in the house? Red wine vinegar and white wine vinegar can be used to deglaze pans. Chicken/beef broth or grape juice can also be used in place of wine in a pinch, especially if a recipe only calls for a small amount.",
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
      "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy."

      "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

      "You have probably heard by now that whole wheat bread is better for you than white bread. While this is true and definitely worth considering, you should be aware that all bread (especially your typical supermarket loaves) will raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation.",
      "Before you pass up garlic because you don't want the bad breath that comes with it, keep in mind that the compounds that cause garlic breath also offer a lot of health benefits. Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
      "If you're following a gluten-free diet, make sure your bread (and all other ingredients) is truly gluten free.",
      "Lycopene, the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy), is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
      "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

      "Fresh herbs can be expensive, so don't let them go to waste. If you have any leftovers, you might be able to freeze them. The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil, while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil, chives, mint, and more."
      ],
      "cooking": [
      "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
      "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
      "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
      "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier."

      "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

        "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
        "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

        "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). ",

        "If you're buying an avocado to use for dinner tonight, make sure you choose a ripe one! Find an avocado that is soft enough to press your fingertips into. If it's too firm, it's not ripe. If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",
        "Like many ground spices, ground nutmeg loses its flavor over time. For the best nutmeg taste, purchase whole nutmeg and grate it right as you use it. If you're a real nutmeg lover, you can even buy a nutmeg grinder. ",
        "There are two types of cinnamon. The more expensive and rarer type is Ceylon cinnamon (considered to be \"true cinnamon\"). The cinnamon most common in North America is cassia cinnamon. Though the flavor is certainly similar, Ceylon cinnamon is said to be more subtle yet also more complex."

For this reason, you definitely cannot substitute sugar with artificial sweeteners 1:1. The other difficulty is making up for the volume you lose when you take out the sugar and replace it with a much smaller quantity of a sugar substitute. Do some <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/healthy/news/sugar-substitutes\">research</a> before you end up with some disappointing baked goods.",
        "If you're buying an avocado to use for dinner tonight, make sure you choose a ripe one! Find an avocado that is soft enough to press your fingertips into. If it's too firm, it's not ripe. If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

        "instructions": "Cut cherries in half and pit them (or use a cherry pitter). Place the cherries in a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 3 hours prior to baking the scones. This ensures the cherries dont pop in the dough while theyre baking.\nIn a KitchenAid (with the wire whisk attachment) or food processor, add the oat flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger and salt. Mix or pulse to combine dry ingredients. In a bowl, combine the applesauce, yogurt, vanilla extract and agave nectar.  Stir to combine Very slowly pour the wet ingredients into the mixer with the dry ingredients about a quarter of a cup at a time (similar idea to making pie crust), mixing on medium speed. Once all the wet ingredients are combined with the dry, add chopped walnuts and mix until integrated into the dough. Taking the dough in your hands, form it into a disc shape. Refrigerate in a sealable container or plastic wrap for 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Using a bread knife, cut the dough in half horizontally like you would a bun. Place half of the frozen cherries on one of the dough halves then place the other half of the dough on top. Press the dough halves together to seal the cherries in.  Press the remaining frozen cherries into the top of the dough. Using a serrated knife, cut diagonals into the dough in order to create eight triangles. Arrange on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet (be sure to give the triangles enough space to bake evenly). Bake for 23 minutes or until the tops of the scones are golden brown.  Serve with butter, jam, honey, or nutella.",

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
        "Many people proclaim the health benefits of honey, saying it possesses antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option.",
        "If you're following a vegan diet (or avoiding dairy), make sure the brand of dough you buy is suitable for your diet! Always read the labels carefully. Otherwise you can make your own from scratch and be 100% sure.",
        "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",
        "Frozen (and potentially even canned) fruit and vegetables contain as much?if not more?vitamins than fresh versions that have been sitting around the supermarket too long. So don't hesitate to buy canned or frozen goods if your budget or the season doesn't allow for fresh!"

        "Sea salt can add a unique texture or provide bursts of salty goodness, but ONLY when it isn't being dissolved. So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

You can even put an apple in the bag with them since apples produce a lot of the gas that encourages ripening (called ethylene). This process takes some time, of course, so if you need ripe bananas immediately you might give the <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5921005/quickly-ripen-bananas-for-baking-and-smoothies-in-the-oven\">oven method</a> a try."

Keep that in mind before you decide to swap. If you want to go dairy free, however, you can replace milk with unsweetened soy milk in most recipes.",

However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",

        "To make baked goods lighter and sneak in some extra nutrition, you can swap half the butter or oil (sometimes even all of it!) with an equal amount of unsweetened applesauce.",

        "You can easily swap half of the white flour in most recipes for whole wheat flour to add some fiber and protein. It does result in a heavier dough, so for cookies, cakes, etc., you might try swapping in whole wheat pastry flour.",
        "Frozen (and potentially even canned) fruit and vegetables contain as much?if not more?vitamins than fresh versions that have been sitting around the supermarket too long. So don't hesitate to buy canned or frozen goods if your budget or the season doesn't allow for fresh!"

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you're using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.",
        "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",
        "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",

        "Choose free range or organic eggs whenever possible! Even though they are more expensive, eggs are generally cheap to begin with, and eggs from cage-free chickens are worth the extra cost.",
        "Eating produce that isn't in season means you're eating fruits and vegetables that have traveled quite awhile to get to you. They lose much of their nutrition during transport, and the long distances are not doing the planet any good either. If you want strawberries in winter, buy them frozen! Also, strawberries are one of the worst offenders when it comes to pesticide residues found on produce, so buy organic when you can."

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option.",
        "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). ",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

These wines are all sweet, which is important since wine should usually be sweeter than the food you're pairing with it. One wine you could try is NV Hunt Country Vineyards Ruby Port Estate Bottled.

This wine features rich berry notes and a long, smooth finish. Our smooth and hearty Ruby Port begins with a blend of Corot Noir and Chambourcin wines. We then fortify the blend with 100% grape brandy (distilled spirits) and sweeten it to bring all the flavors into perfect balance. Serve at cool room temperature.",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

        "Corn starch, potato starch, arrowroot powder, and tapioca powder are all comparable in terms of thickening ability, so you can usually substitute them 1:1.

However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

        "If you're trying to <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sugar-nutrient\">cut back on sugar</a>, consider replacing some of the sugar in this recipe with a sweetener like Stevia or Splenda. If you're against these kinds of sweeteners, start reducing the amount of real sugar you use until your tastebuds adjust. ",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

        "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",

        "There are two types of cinnamon. The more expensive and rarer type is Ceylon cinnamon (considered to be \"true cinnamon\"). The cinnamon most common in North America is cassia cinnamon. Though the flavor is certainly similar, Ceylon cinnamon is said to be more subtle yet also more complex.",

Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. You could try NV Solera Cream Sherry.

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",
        "Many people proclaim the health benefits of honey, saying it possesses antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option.",
        "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

        "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking."

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

Turn it off and let cool completely.\nStrain out the mint leaves and lavender and pour the cooled syrup into an ice cube tray - should make roughly 4 syrup cubes. Place the tray in the freezer until syrup is frozen (the cubes may remain a little mushy as a result of all the sugar.)\nOnce the berries and herb-infused syrup cubes have frozen, you can make the sorbet. Place the frozen berries and syrup cubes in the bowl of a cuisinart or blender and add a few teaspoons of ice water to aid in blending.

Stir in the toasted pecans.\nIn a separate bowl combine the raisins with the rum, the yogurt, and honey.\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry. Mix until the dough is too stiff to stir. Use your hands to bring it together in the bowl. Add additional yogurt one teaspoon at a time if its too dry. You want a stiff, slightly tacky ball.\nTurn dough onto a lightly floured board and shape into a round loaf. (Dont over-knead the dough. Too much kneading will produce a tough bread.).\nTransfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make deep slashes across the top of the loaf, 4-6 cuts about half way through. Brush the top with milk. Sprinkle with seeds or oats if using.\nBake for 40-45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. When you tap the loaf, it will sound hollow.\nCool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with a generous slather of butter.",

Keep that in mind before you decide to swap. If you want to go dairy free, however, you can replace milk with unsweetened soy milk in most recipes.",
        "You can easily swap half of the white flour in most recipes for whole wheat flour to add some fiber and protein. It does result in a heavier dough, so for cookies, cakes, etc., you might try swapping in whole wheat pastry flour.",
        "Many people proclaim the health benefits of honey, saying it possesses antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option.",
        "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil, while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil, chives, mint, and more.",
        "Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

        "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",

        "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",

If you're against these kinds of sweeteners, start reducing the amount of real sugar you use until your tastebuds adjust. ",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

        "If you're worried about cholesterol and heart disease, you may have heard you should limit your egg consumption to one egg per day or eat only egg whites. However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

        "There are two types of cinnamon. The more expensive and rarer type is Ceylon cinnamon (considered to be \"true cinnamon\"). The cinnamon most common in North America is cassia cinnamon.

Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit.

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets.

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

          "Size doesn't matter (when buying asparagus). Look for firm, straight stalks and an even green color. Leave limp and otherwise sad looking asparagus behind. Store in the fridge, but use within a few days.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

These unique AVAs lend this wine its signature characteristics. The cool, foggy Hudson vineyard imparts this wine with a smoky, gamey nose layered with white and black pepper along with some floral notes, while the sunny and rocky Stagecoach vineyard lends this wine intense and concentrated fruit aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, and huckleberry pie. The Hudson vineyard also brings beautiful, bright raspberries, black pepper, smoke, finesse, and a lively acid to the palate, whereas theStagecoach vineyard adds dark fruit, great concentration, and structure. The whole-cluster fermentation adds more complexity with some green peppercorn and spice in the finish, and the oak imparts smokiness to the nose and bittersweet chocolate to the finish.",

The palate is a heightened reflection of aroma, bursting with more citrus and stone fruits and showing a bit of the wet-stone minerality that will develop with time. The long, layered finish follows through with just a hint of sweet pink grapefruit.",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

On the palate is an explosion of red fruits and minerality supported by a very round structure. The tannins are mature and present a long finish with hints of blonde tobacco. This wine can be decanted and enjoyed now, or it can be placed in your cellar. Before 2011, decant for full enjoyment.",

The pork can be either shredded for cubed for your preference. *3</li><li>Serving Suggestion: Scoop about 1 cup of beans with broth into a soup bowl. Top with shredded pork. Add 1/4 of an avocado sliced, top with chopped fresh cilantro.</li><li>NOTES:</li><li>*1 The beans do not need to be soaked before adding to the slow cooker. They will be perfectly soft and creamy without pre-soaking.</li><li>*2 Substitute the water for: 2 cups water and 1 bottle of good quality dark beer like Negra Modelo. You can also substitute the water for chicken stock or pork stock. Each of these substitutions will add an extra dimension of flavor.</li><li>*3 If you want to shred the pork, it is easiest to do when the pork is hot. Use two forks to pull the pork apart and shred. If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold. Let the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night. Slice with a serrated knife or a very sharp chef knife.</li></ol>",

          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
          "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",
          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",

One wine you could try is NV Paques et Fils. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 36 dollars.",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
          "Carrots can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. The starch in the carrots will turn to sugar over time, but this is not a problem, they'll just taste sweeter. The academy lesson about <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/carrots\">carrots</a> contains more useful information.",
          "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
          "Kosher salt is a type of coarse-grained salt popular among chefs because it is easy to pick up with the fingertips and sticks well when coating meat. The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you're using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.",
          "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

          "instructions": "Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",

Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 40 to 60 minutes. Take care not to overcook  the beans should be tender but not be falling apart. Drain and set aside.To prepare the eggplant, cut of the stem and bottom edge and then cut in half lengthwise. Score the flesh into diagonal 1-inch lines, then turn and score again until you have a diagonal pattern. Take care not to cut through the skin. Sprinkle with some salt and let sit for 40 minutes. Rinse and squeeze out any excess water. Brush the eggplant with some oil and transfer to a roasting pan. Bake in a preheated 400 oven until the flesh appears collapsed and is wrinkly. Remove from heat and let cool for about 10 minutes, season with a bit of salt, and remove the flesh from the eggplant. If there is too much water, drain in a strainer. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in the same saucepan used to cook the black-eyed peas. When hot, toss in the shallots and chilies and saut for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the spices and stir for another minute, until fragrant. Add the tomato, cook for another few minutes, and then add the eggplant and black-eyed peas, and cook for another few minutes, stirring often.Pour a few tablespoons of water into the pan and add handfuls of chard at a time until wilted. Add more water as necessary. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste near the end of the cooking time. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes before serving.",

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

          "instructions": "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!",

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

          "Many people will tell you to remove the skin on your chicken to cut down on fat. This is true, but if you like the taste, leave it on! You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too.

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",

This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene.

Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money).",

          "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",
          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Carrots can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. The starch in the carrots will turn to sugar over time, but this is not a problem, they'll just taste sweeter.

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
